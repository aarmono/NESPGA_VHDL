===============
The DASM Oracle
===============

Climbing the last few steps, you have finally reached the mystical
Oracle of DASM my weary apprentice. Come now and gaze upon a future
once unknown to mere mortals.

    * ftohex seems to be broken compared to Matt Dillon's 2.16 so we
      will probably import his version; while at it we'll grab his
      ftobin tool as well

    * error messages currently going to stdout will go to stderr
      instead; prepare to adjust your development environments if
      you're using those messages for something automated

    * command line option parsing will get an overhaul, either we
      switch to GNU getopt, or we'll roll our own improved parsing;
      gone will be the days of not being able to put a space where
      you wanted one; we'll also have --long-options (we hope)

If you have any ideas for DASM's future, please feel free to contact
us. Visit http://dasm-dillon.sf.net/ for more information.
